#AD527X

Arduino library for Analog Devices AD5272 and AD5274 Digital Rheostats with I2C

AD5274 is 8 bits (256-positions)
AD5272 is 12 bits (1024- positions)
There are 20 kΩ, 50 kΩ, 100 kΩ nominal resistance versions.
We are mostly chaning the position of the IC, and are making no use of the 50-TP storage
